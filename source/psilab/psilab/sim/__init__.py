"""Sub-package containing simulation-specific functionalities.

These include:

* Ability to spawn different objects and materials into Omniverse
* Define and modify various schemas on USD prims
* Converters to obtain USD file from other file formats (such as URDF, OBJ, STL, FBX)
* Utility class to control the simulator

.. note::
    Currently, only a subset of all possible schemas and prims in Omniverse are supported.
    We are expanding the these set of functions on a need basis. In case, there are
    specific prims or schemas that you would like to include, please open an issue on GitHub
    as a feature request elaborating on the required application.

To make it convenient to use the module, we recommend importing the module as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    import isaaclab.sim as sim_utils

"""
